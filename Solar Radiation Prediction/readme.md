Solar radiation varies due to change in different parameters like temperature, pressure, wind direction, humidity, etc. 
Hence to study the solar radiation we used meteorological records collected by the HI-SEAS weather station from four months 
(September through December 2016). The dataset depicts variations in solar radiation with respect to its parameters. 
It has approx. 33000 rows and 10 different parameters on which radiation depends. The goal of the project is to find 
the most suitable atmospheric conditions to capture solar energy and to predict the solar radiation given the parameters.

Random forest regressor and XGBoost were found to be the most effective techniques in predicting the solar radiations leading to 98.9% accuracy.

Practical Applications:
1)Estimate battery life of a solar cell during a particular time of the year.
2)Find perfect climatic conditions to capture solar energy.
